Backend proxy/routing issue preventing API calls."

Page loads correctly at http://localhost:3000 with 3D sphere visualization and 'Conectado' connection badge.

    message: "❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND AFTER WS ADJUSTMENTS: Frontend loads correctly but backend API integration is broken. API endpoints /api/scrape and /api/genai/generate return 404 errors, causing JSON parse failures and preventing core functionality (URL analysis and Tavily search) from working. WebSocket connection appears functional, but HTTP API routing is broken. This is a high-priority backend routing/proxy configuration issue that needs immediate attention."
